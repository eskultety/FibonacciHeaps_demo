FibonacciHeaps_demo
===================
The goal of this project is to create a simple graphical didactic application
demonstrating the usage of Fibonacci's heaps rather than priority queues within
the Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm in order to achieve better time
complexity (most operations run at amortized time O(1)) than we'd achieve
with regular priority queues.
